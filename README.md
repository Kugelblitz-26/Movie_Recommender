## Features

- **Recommendation Engine**: A content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based on user profiles.
- **Flask Web App**: An intuitive web interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to various movie datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature extraction, and TF-IDF vectorization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git@github.com:Kugelblitz-26/Movie_Recommender.git
   cd movie-recommendation-flask
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your movie dataset in CSV format, including essential features like movie titles, descriptions, genres, and tags.

2. Run the Flask web application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the Movie Recommendation System by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Model Creation

1. Preprocess your movie dataset to clean and structure the data properly.

2. Implement a TF-IDF vectorizer for textual data to convert it into numerical features.

3. Compute similarity scores between movies to determine the level of similarity.

4. Create the recommendation model to provide personalized suggestions to users.

5. Serialize and save the recommendation model (e.g., using `pickle`) as a `.pkl` file for easy integration into the Flask application.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed on hosting platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other service that supports Python web applications. Be sure to set up any necessary environment variables for secure deployment.
